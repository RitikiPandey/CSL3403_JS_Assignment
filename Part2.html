        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <li>In programming, a variable can be declared and defined inside a class, method, or block. It defines the
            scope of the variable i.e. the visibility or accessibility of a variable.</li>
        <li>When a variable is defined globally then it is visible to every part of the code and can be accessed from
            any part of the code, such variables are called GLOBAL VARIABLES, defined under GLOBAL SCOPE.</li>
        <li>When a variable is defined locally that is within a block, then it is visible only within that block and can
            be accessed only in that block, such variables are called LOCAL VARIABLES, defined under LOCAL SCOPE.</li>
